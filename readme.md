# Android Floating player (ExoPLayer)
A floating player i have created one year ago to use it with my previous apps, decided to publish it as open source project :)

# Install
Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```
	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

Step 2. Add the dependency
```
	dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.msxenon:CustomExoPlayer:Tag'
	}
```
